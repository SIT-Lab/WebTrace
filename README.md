# WebTrace: An Enhanced System for Remote User Interaction Tracking and Analysis in Web Applications

WebTrace is a web-based tool that tracks, abstracts and analyzes user interactions for usability testing in web applications. WebTrace facilitates lightweight and effective usability testing by simplifying both participation and analysis processes. The tool comprises two main modules:

- **WebTrace Tracker**: A Chrome extension that tracks user interactions, such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, during usability testing
- **WebTrace Dashboard**: A web application that enables testers to manage tests, abstract collected interaction data, and support data analysis.

These two modules work together to track user interactions through the Tracker and analyze them using the Dashboard.
This repository serves as an overview of the WebTrace project. For detailed information on each module, please visit their respective GitHub repositories.

## Modules

### WebTrace Modules

[WebTrace Tracker GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SIT-Lab/WebTrace-Tracker)

WebTrace Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to track user interactions during usability testing. It captures various interaction data such as mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and keyboard inputs, which are then stored in Firebase for analysis.

### WebTrace Dashboard

[WebTrace Dashboard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SIT-Lab/WebTrace-Dashboard)

WebTrace Dashboard is a web application that allows administrators to manage tests. Additionally, it provides tools for analyzing the interaction data collected by the WebTrace Tracker, including the abstraction of repetitive data into more readable datasets.
